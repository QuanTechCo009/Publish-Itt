# Author OS - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a private, in-house "Author OS" web app for managing books, chapters, publishing workflow, tone analysis, and art prompt generation. The application should feature a rich text editor, multiple workspaces for different tasks (Manuscript, Workflow, Tone & Style, Art Studio), and a dashboard to view all projects.

## Core Requirements

### User Personas
- **Primary User**: Authors managing multiple book projects
- **Use Case**: Writing, organizing, and refining manuscripts with AI assistance

### Core Screens
1. **Dashboard** - Project overview with quick actions
2. **Manuscript Workspace** - Rich text editor with chapter management
3. **Workflow Workspace** - Publishing pipeline visualization
4. **Tone & Style Workspace** - Tone analysis tools
5. **Art Studio** - AI art prompt generation
6. **Market Intelligence** - Market analysis and book idea generation
7. **Settings** - Style preset management

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui, TipTap Editor
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-5.2 via Emergent LLM Key

## Data Models

### Primary Collections
- `projects` - Book projects (legacy, being migrated)
- `manuscripts_collection` - Unified manuscript records (new)
- `chapters` - Individual chapters with content
- `versions` - Content snapshots for version history
- `notes` - Notes and comments for chapters/manuscripts
- `style_presets` - Writing style configurations
- `art_assets` - Generated art assets
- `tone_profiles` - Tone analysis results

### Key Relationships
- Projects → Chapters (one-to-many)
- Chapters → Versions (one-to-many)
- Chapters → Notes (one-to-many)
- Manuscripts can have Versions and Notes directly
